{% section Episodic Diversification Rate Models | models %}


The basic idea behind the model is that speciation and extinction rates are constant
within time intervals but can be different between time intervals.
Thus, we will divide time into equally sized intervals.
An overview of the underlying theory of the specific model and implementation
is given in {% citet Hoehna2015a Magee2021 %}.

Two scenarios of birth-death models. On the left we show constant diversification.
On the right we show an example of an episodic birth-death process where rates
are constant in each time interval (epoch). The top panel of this figure shows
an example realization under the given rates.

{% ref fig_EBD %} shows an example of a constant rate birth-death process and
an episodic birth-death process.

We assume that the log-transformed rates follow a Horseshoe Markov random field (HSMRF) prior distribution {% citet Magee2020 %}.
This prior assumes that rates are autocorrelated, that is, rates in the current time interval will be centered around the rates in the previous time interval.
The assumption of autocorrelated rates does not only makes sense biologically but also improves our ability to estimate parameters.
The HSMRF allows for periods of relatively constant rates interspersed with large jumps, and can be used with large numbers of intervals (hundreds) to provide fine-scale detail in estimated rates.

{% figcaption %}
A graphical model with the outline of the `Rev` code. On the left we see a
 graphical model describing the HSMRF model for rate-variation through time.
On the right we show the corresponding `Rev` commands to instantiate this model.
This figure gives a complete overview of the model that we use here in this analysis.
There are many ways to represent the HSMRF model, this one is easy to read, but
more computationally burdensome than the version we will use in practice.

We show an idealized graphical model of the episodic birth-death process with autocorrelated rates
in {% ref fig_EBD_GM %}.
This graphical model shows you which variables are included in the model,
and the dependency between the variables.
Thus, it makes the structure and assumption of the model clear and
visible instead of a black-box {% cite Hoehna2014b %}.
For example, you see how the speciation and extinction rates in each time interval
depend on the rates of the previous interval, and that we use a hyperprior for
the standard deviation of rates between time intervals.
Note that the actual set up of the plates in Rev code will appear to differ from what is shown here.
This is because there are many ways to represent the HSMRF model, and with some
small reparameterization and a function to replace the plate(s), we can make
it run much more efficiently and easily in MCMC.
