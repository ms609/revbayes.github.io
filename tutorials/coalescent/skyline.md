{% section Skyline Plots %}
Skyline Plots are models for how population size changes through time.
The classical skyline plot {% cite Pybus2000 %} provided the first implementation of this idea.
For each interval between two coalescent events, an effective population size was calculated.
This led to a plot looking very similar to a skyline, thus giving the method its name (see {% ref classical-skyline %} for a hypothetical example).
The generalized skyline plot {% cite Strimmer2001 %} aimed at reducing the noise from analyzing every single interval by grouping several coalescent events into one interval.
This created a smoother curve.
First, these models were used for maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of population sizes through time.
By now, several extensions allowing for Bayesian estimation have been published (see for example {% citet Drummond2005 Heled2008 Gill2012 %}).
In `RevBayes`, a Skyline plot method is implemented with constant population size intervals.
In other software, you can also find the possibility to have linear skyline intervals.
Even though this is not implemented explicitly as skyline in `RevBayes`, you can also piece together linear intervals (have a look at the [piecewise model exercise]({{base.url}}/tutorials/coalescent/piecewise), if you are interested in this).
<!--- The length of these intervals is not based on the timing of the coalescent events, but can be individually chosen. --->
The length of the skyline intervals can either be defined by a specific number of intervals ending at coalescent events, or alternatively be chosen individually without depending on the coalescent events.
<!--- In this tutorial, each interval will have the same length. --->
In this exercise, each interval will group five coalescent events.
Have a look at {% ref event-skyline %}, for a hypothetical example with three events per interval.

{% aside Likelihood Calculation %}

We assume that the phylogeny of the samples is known.
There are $n$ samples, with $k$ active lineages at the current point in time $t$.
Time starts at $t = 0$.
The waiting times between coalescent events $w_k$ are exponentially distributed with rate $c = \frac{k (k-1)}{2N_e(t)}$ with $N_e$ being the population size.
<!--- In the case of a skyline plot, the population size curve is split into $m$ intervals which each have a starting point $t_i$. --->

The likelihood for a Skyline Plot is the product of the probability density functions of the coalescent waiting times, which are calculated as follows:

$$p(w_k | t_k) = \frac{k (k -1)}{2N_e(t_k + w_k)} exp \left[ \int_{t_k}^{t_k+w_k} \frac{k (k -1)}{2N_e(t)} dt \right]$$

Each $t_k$ is the beginning of the respective kth coalescent interval.
The waiting times $w_k$ refer to the waiting time starting when there are $k$ active lineages.

<!--- In our case, $N_e(t)$ is a piecewise constant demographic function with $m$ intervals which each have a starting point $t_i$ and the length $l$.
**Do I need to go into the intervals here?** --->

{% section Inference Example %}

> ## For your info
> The entire process of the skyline estimation can be executed by using the **mcmc_homochronous_skyline.Rev** script that you can download on the left side of the page.
> Save it in your **scripts** directory.
> You can type the following command into `RevBayes`:
~~~
> source("scripts/mcmc_homochronous_skyline.Rev")
~~~
We will walk you through the script in the following section.
{:.info}

We will mainly highlight the parts of the script that change compared to the [constant coalescent model]({{base.url}}/tutorials/coalescent/constant).

{% subsection Read the data %}
Read in the data as described in the first exercise.

{% subsection The Skyline Model %}
For the skyline model, you need to decide on the number of intervals.
In order to get five coalescent events per interval, we divide the number of coalescent events by five.
With $n$ taxa, we expect $(n-1)$ coalescent events, until there is only one lineage left.

~~~
NUM_INTERVALS = ceil((n_taxa - 1) / 5)
~~~

For each interval, a population size will be estimated. Choose a prior and add a move for each population size.

~~~
for (i in 1:NUM_INTERVALS) {
    pop_size[i] ~ dnUniform(0,1E6)
    pop_size[i].setValue(100)
    moves.append( mvScale(pop_size[i], lambda=0.1, tune=true, weight=2.0) )
}
~~~


{% subsection The Tree %}

Now, we will instantiate the stochastic node for the tree.
The Skyline distribution function `dnCoalescentSkyline` takes the vector of population sizes the taxa as input. <!--- **(need to check whether it can take more)** --->
By chosing `methods="events"`, the interval lengths will be chosen based on the number of events.

~~~
psi ~ dnCoalescentSkyline(theta=pop_size, method="events", taxa=taxa)
~~~

In order to be able to later plot and analyze the population size curve, we need to retrieve the resulting interval times.

~~~
interval_times := psi.getIntervalAges()
~~~

For this analysis, we constrain the root age as before and add the same moves for the tree.

{% subsection Substitution Model and other parameters %}
This part is also taken from the constant coalescent exercise.

{% subsection Finalize and run the analysis %}

In the end, we need to wrap our model as before.

Finally, we add the monitors and then run the MCMC.
Here, another monitor is added for the interval times.

~~~
monitors.append( mnModel(filename="output/example_skyline.log",printgen=THINNING) )
monitors.append( mnFile(filename="output/example_skyline.trees",psi,printgen=THINNING) )
monitors.append( mnFile(filename="output/example_skyline_NEs.log",pop_size,printgen=THINNING) )
monitors.append( mnFile(filename="output/example_skyline_times.log",interval_times,printgen=THINNING) )
monitors.append( mnScreen(pop_size, root_age, printgen=100) )
~~~


{% section Results %}

After running your analysis, you can plot the results again using the `R` package `RevGadgets`.

~~~
library(RevGadgets)

burnin = 0.1
probs = c(0.025, 0.975)
summary = "median"

population_size_log = "output/horses_skyline_NEs.log"
interval_change_points_log = "output/horses_skyline_times.log"
df <- processPopSizes(population_size_log, interval_change_points_log, method = "events", burnin = burnin, probs = probs, summary = summary)
p <- plotPopSizes(df) + ggplot2::coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1e3, 1e8))
ggplot2::ggsave("horses_skyline.png", p)
~~~

{% figure example_skyline %}
<img src="figures/horses_skyline.png" width="800">
{% figcaption %}
This is how the resulting skyline plot should roughly look like.
{% endfigcaption %}
{% endfigure %}

{% section Next Exercise %}
When you are done, have a look at the next exercise.
