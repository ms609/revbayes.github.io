{% section Overview %}
This page provides you with scripts for a skyline analysis with a compound poisson prior on the left side.
It is in addition to the [Gaussian Markov Random Field Prior tutorial]({{base.url}}/tutorials/coalescent/GMRF).

{% section Results %}
After running your analysis, you can plot the results using the `R` package `RevGadgets`.

{% figcaption %}
This is how the resulting rjMCMC plot should roughly look like.
