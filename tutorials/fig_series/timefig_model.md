{% section Introduction | introduction %}

This introduces a tutorial series for using the feature-informed geographic state-dependent speciation-extinction (FIGeoSSE or FIG) model for phylogenetic biogeography in RevBayes. This series targets biologists who are familiar with phylogenetic models and are interested in the following biogeographic areas:

- biogeographic model design
- ancestral range estimation
- divergence time estimation using paleogeography (biogeographic dating)
- detecting relationships between regional features and biogeographic rates
- modeling biogeographic rates through time


The series was written for the 2024 Phylogenetic Biogeography Workshop in St. Louis as part of an NSF-funded project on Modeling the Origin and Evolution of Hawaiian Plants.
