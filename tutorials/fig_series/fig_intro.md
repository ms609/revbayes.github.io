{% section Introduction | introduction %}

This introduces a tutorial series for using the feature-informed geographic state-dependent speciation-extinction (FIGeoSSE or FIG) model for phylogenetic biogeography in RevBayes. This series targets biologists who are familiar with phylogenetic models and are interested in the following biogeographic areas:

- biogeographic model design
- ancestral range estimation
- divergence time estimation using paleogeography (biogeographic dating)
- detecting relationships between regional features and biogeographic rates
- modeling biogeographic rates through time

Tutorials in this series are:
- GeoSSE model: {% page_ref fig_series/molecular_dating %}
- FIG model: {% page_ref fig_series/fig_model %}
- TimeFIG model: {% page_ref fig_series/timefig_model %}
- Biogeographic dating with TimeFIG: {% page_ref fig_series/timefig_dating %}

The series was written for the 2024 Phylogenetic Biogeography Workshop in St. Louis as part of an NSF-funded project on Modeling the Origin and Evolution of Hawaiian Plants.
