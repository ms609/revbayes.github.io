Exercise 2
===========
{:.section}

In [exercise 1]({{ base.url }}/tutorials/dating/global) we inferred the phylogeny of living bears and estimated relative node ages assuming a global molecular clock model.
In this exercise we will relax the assumption of constant rates across the tree and use a relaxed molecular clock model that allows each branch in the tree to have an independent rate.
