{% section Brownian-motion Model %}

Under the simple Brownian-motion (BM) model, the evolution of a continuous character is entirely determined by a single rate parameter, $\sigma^2$. The expected amount of change over a single branch of length $t$ is zero, and the variance in changes is $t \times \sigma^2$. We can estimate the posterior distribution of the rate parameter under this model by placing a prior on $\sigma^2$. The resulting graphical model is quite simple, as the probability of the continuous characters depends only on the phylogeny (which we assume to be known in this tutorial) and the rate parameter ({% ref fig_bm_gm %}).

For this exercise, we will specify a BM model, such that the rate parameter is a stochastic node, drawn from a Loguniform prior distribution, as depicted in {% ref fig_bm_gm %}. As we are specifying a Bayesian model, we focus on estimating the posterior distribution of the rate parameter given the continuous characters, $X$:

$$
\begin{equation}
    P(\sigma^2 \mid X) = \frac{P(X \mid \sigma^2) P(\sigma^2)}{P(X)}
\tag{Bayes Theorem}\label{eq:bayes_thereom}
\end{equation}
$$

In this tutorial, we use the 66 vertebrate phylogenies and (log) body-size datasets from {% cite Landis2017b %}.

&#8680; The full BM-model specification is in the file called `mcmc_BM.Rev`.

{% subsection Read the data %}

We begin by deciding which of the 66 vertebrate datasets to use. Here, we assume we are analyzing the first dataset (Cetacea), but you should feel free to choose any of the datasets.
```
dataset <- 11
```

Now, we read in the (time-calibrated) tree corresponding to our chosen dataset.
```
T <- readTrees("data/trees.nex")[dataset]
```

Next, we read in the character data for the same dataset.
```
data <- readContinuousCharacterData("data/traits.nex")[dataset]
```

Additionally, we initialize a variable for our vector of
moves and monitors:
```
moves    = VectorMoves()
monitors = VectorMonitors()
```

{% subsection Specifying the model %}

{% subsubsection Tree model %}

In this tutorial, we assume the tree is known without area. We create a constant node for the tree that corresponds to the observed phylogeny.

```
tree <- T
```

{% subsubsection Rate parameter %}

The constant-rate BM model has just one parameter, $\sigma^2$. We draw the rate parameter from a loguniform prior. This prior is uniform on the log scale, which means that it is represents ignorance about the _order of magnitude_ of the rate.

```
sigma2 ~ dnLoguniform(1e-3, 1)
```

In order to estimate the posterior distribution of $\sigma^2$, we must provide an MCMC proposal mechanism that operates on this node. Because $\sigma^2$ is a rate parameter, and must therefore be positive, we use a scaling move called `mvScale`.
```
moves.append( mvScale(sigma2, weight=1.0) )
```

{% subsubsection Brownian-motion model %}

Now that we have specified the parameters of the model, we can draw the character data from the corresponding phylogenetic Brownian-motion model. In this example, we use the REML algorithm to efficiently compute the likelihood {% cite Felsenstein1985a %}. We provide the square root of the variance parameter, $\sigma$, to `dnPhyloBrownianREML`:
```
X ~ dnPhyloBrownianREML(tree, branchRates=sigma2^0.5)
```

Noting that $X$ is the observed data ({% ref fig_bm_gm %}), we clamp the `data` to this stochastic node.
```
X.clamp(data)
```

Finally, we create a workspace object for the entire model with `model()`. Remeber that workspace objects are initialized with the `=` operator, and are not themselves part of the Bayesian graphical model. The `model()` function traverses the entire model graph and finds all the nodes in the model that we specified. This object provides a convenient way to refer to the whole model object, rather than just a single DAG node.

```
mymodel = model(sigma2)
```

{% subsection Running an MCMC analysis %}

{% subsubsection Specifying Monitors %}

For our MCMC analysis, we need to set up a vector of *monitors* to record the states of our Markov chain. The monitor functions are all called `mn*`, where `*` is the wildcard representing the monitor type. First, we will initialize the model monitor using the `mnModel` function. This creates a new monitor variable that will output the states for all model parameters when passed into a MCMC function.
```
monitors.append( mnModel(filename="output/simple_BM.log", printgen=10) )
```
Additionally, create a screen monitor that will report the states of
specified variables to the screen with `mnScreen`:
```
monitors.append( mnScreen(printgen=1000, sigma2) )
```

{% subsubsection Initializing and Running the MCMC Simulation %}

With a fully specified model, a set of monitors, and a set of moves, we
can now set up the MCMC algorithm that will sample parameter values in
proportion to their posterior probability. The `mcmc()` function will
create our MCMC object:
```
mymcmc = mcmc(mymodel, monitors, moves, nruns=2, combine="mixed")
```
Now, run the MCMC:
```
mymcmc.run(generations=50000)
```
When the analysis is complete, you will have the monitored files in your
output directory.
